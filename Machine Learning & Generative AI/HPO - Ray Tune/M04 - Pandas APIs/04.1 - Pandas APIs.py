# MAGIC ### 1.2 Performance Test: Comparing Pandas, Spark, and Pandas API on Spark
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this part of the demo, we can compare the performance of **Pandas**, **Spark**, and **Pandas API on Spark (Koalas)** for various data operations, such as computing the mean of numeric columns. This comparison helps in understanding the efficiency of each framework, particularly in different computational environments (single-node vs. distributed).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The image below serves as a benchmark comparison, illustrating the execution times for each framework across different operations. Key insights:
# MAGIC - **Suitability of Each Framework**: Sparkâ€™s distributed processing is highly effective with large datasets, making it ideal for big data tasks, while Pandas excels on smaller datasets due to its minimal overhead.
# MAGIC - **Framework-Specific Strengths and Limitations**: Some operations, like joins, may perform differently based on the framework used, with Spark often handling large data joins more efficiently than Pandas or Pandas API on Spark.
# MAGIC - **Importance of Tool Selection**: Choosing the appropriate tool for a given data size and complexity can significantly impact performance, which is crucial in production settings where optimization is key.

# MAGIC ## Part 2: Converting Between DataFrames
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, we will explore how to convert between different types of DataFrames: Spark, Pandas, and Pandas API on Spark. This flexibility allows you to take advantage of the specific features and performance benefits of each framework based on your data processing needs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By converting between DataFrame types, you can use the familiar syntax of Pandas with the distributed capabilities of Spark, or switch to Pandas when you're working with smaller datasets locally.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### 2.1 Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas API on Spark DataFrame
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In some cases, you might want to work with a Pandas-like syntax while still leveraging Sparkâ€™s distributed architecture. This can be achieved by converting a Spark DataFrame into a Pandas API on Spark DataFrame (previously Koalas). Letâ€™s see how to do that:

# COMMAND ----------

# Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas API on Spark DataFrame
pandas_on_spark_df = airbnb_df.to_pandas_on_spark()

# Display the DataFrame in Pandas API on Spark format
display(pandas_on_spark_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### 2.2 Convert Pandas API on Spark DataFrame Back to Spark DataFrame
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once you have finished operations using Pandas API on Spark, you might need to convert it back to a Spark DataFrame to use Spark-specific functions or take advantage of Sparkâ€™s distributed processing features for tasks like machine learning with Spark MLlib.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# Convert Pandas API on Spark DataFrame back to Spark DataFrame
spark_df = pandas_on_spark_df.to_spark()

# Display the converted Spark DataFrame
display(spark_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### 2.3 Convert Pandas API on Spark DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In some cases, you may want to bring the data back into a local Pandas DataFrame, such as when working with a smaller subset of the data or applying operations exclusive to Pandas.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC For more on Pandas API on Spark, you can refer to the official [Pandas API on Spark Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/quickstart_ps.html).
# MAGIC

# MAGIC ## Part 3: Applying Pandas UDF to a Spark DataFrame
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, you will use a **pre-trained RandomForest model** from Scikit-learn and apply it to a Spark DataFrame using a **Pandas UDF**. This process allows you to leverage the trained model to make predictions on distributed Spark DataFrames, providing scalable and efficient predictions across large datasets.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why Use Pandas UDFs?**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Pandas UDFs are optimized for distributed data processing in Spark. By applying Pandas UDFs, you can run functions on Spark DataFrames that expect Pandas DataFrames as input, which is useful for machine learning models trained outside of the Spark ecosystem, like Scikit-learn models.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### 3.1 Training a RandomForest Model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC First, we will train a **RandomForest model** using Scikit-learn on a **local Pandas DataFrame**. This model will predict the `price` column based on features in the Airbnb dataset.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Convert the Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame.
# MAGIC 2. Separate the features (`X`) and target variable (`y`).
# MAGIC 3. Train the RandomForest model on the training data.

# COMMAND ----------

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Convert Spark DataFrame to Pandas DataFrame for local model training
airbnb_pandas_df = airbnb_df.toPandas()

# Features and target variable
X = airbnb_pandas_df.drop(columns=["price"])  # Exclude target column
y = airbnb_pandas_df["price"]  # Target column

# Train the RandomForest model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X, y)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### 3.2 Define and Apply a Pandas UDF
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, we will define a **Pandas UDF** that takes in the features from the Spark DataFrame, uses the trained RandomForest model to make predictions, and returns the predicted values for each row.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Define the Pandas UDF to apply the pre-trained RandomForest model. We do this by appending our function `predict_udf` with the decorator `@pandas_udf`.
# MAGIC 2. Use the UDF to process the input columns and generate predictions.

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
import pandas as pd

# Define a Pandas UDF to apply the trained RandomForest model
@pandas_udf("double")  # Output type of the UDF is a double (for predicted price)
def predict_udf(*cols: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    # Combine input columns into a single DataFrame for model prediction
    features = pd.concat(cols, axis=1)
    # Return predictions from the trained RandomForest model
    return pd.Series(model.predict(features))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### 3.3 Applying the Pandas UDF to the Spark DataFrame
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, you can apply the `predict_udf` to the Spark DataFrame to generate predictions for each row. This allows you to distribute the prediction process across the cluster, making it scalable for larger datasets.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Apply the `predict_udf` to the Spark DataFrame.
# MAGIC 2. Exclude the target column (`price`) when applying the UDF.
# MAGIC 3. Add a new column, `prediction`, containing the predicted price.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
import pandas as pd

# Define the features used for prediction, excluding "price"
feature_names = [col for col in airbnb_df.columns if col != "price"]

@pandas_udf("double")
def predict_udf(*cols: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    # Combine input columns into a DataFrame for model prediction
    features = pd.concat(cols, axis=1)
    features.columns = feature_names  # Set the correct feature names
    
    # Return predictions from the trained RandomForest model
    return pd.Series(model.predict(features))

# Apply the Pandas UDF to the Spark DataFrame for predictions, excluding "price"
prediction_df = airbnb_df.select([col for col in feature_names]).withColumn(
    "prediction", 
    predict_udf(*[airbnb_df[col] for col in feature_names])
)

# Display the DataFrame with predictions
display(prediction_df)

# MAGIC ## Part 4: Training Group-Specific Models with Pandas Function API
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, you will learn how to **train group-specific models** for each neighborhood using the **Pandas Function API**. By splitting the dataset based on a grouping criterion (in this case, `neighbourhood_cleansed`), we can train individual machine learning models for each group and log them using **MLflow**. This approach is useful when different groups of data may benefit from customized models.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why Group-Specific Models?**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Group-specific models allow for fine-tuned predictions by training separate models for each group, which can often yield better results compared to training a single model for the entire dataset. In this example, each **neighborhood** will have its own trained model.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### 4.1 Define the Group-Specific Model Training Function
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will define a function that:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Trains a RandomForest model** for each neighborhood group.
# MAGIC - **Logs the model** in **MLflow**.
# MAGIC - **Calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for model performance evaluation.
# MAGIC - **Returns key metrics**, including the model path, MSE, and the number of records used in the training.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Extract the `neighbourhood_cleansed` for each group.
# MAGIC 2. Define the feature set (`X_group`) and the target (`y_group`).
# MAGIC 3. Train a RandomForest model for the group.
# MAGIC 4. Log the model in MLflow.
# MAGIC 5. Return the model's URI, MSE, and other group-specific metrics.

# COMMAND ----------

# Define a pandas function to train a group-specific model and log each model with MLflow
def train_group_model(df_pandas: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Get the neighborhood name
    neighbourhood = df_pandas['neighbourhood_cleansed'].iloc[0]
    
    # Define features (X) and target variable (y)
    X_group = df_pandas.drop(columns=["price", "neighbourhood_cleansed"])
    y_group = df_pandas["price"]
    
    # Train a RandomForest model for the group
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_group, y_group)
    
    # Log the model using MLflow
    with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):
        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "random_forest_model")
        model_uri = mlflow.get_artifact_uri("random_forest_model")
    
    # Calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the group
    predictions = model.predict(X_group)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_group, predictions)

    # Return a DataFrame containing group information and model performance
    return pd.DataFrame({
        "neighbourhood_cleansed": [str(neighbourhood)],  # Neighborhood name
        "model_path": [str(model_uri)],                  # MLflow model URI

        "n_used": [int(len(df_pandas))]                  # Number of records used in training
    })

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### 4.2 Apply the Group-Specific Function Using Pandas API
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, we will use the **Pandas Function API** to apply the group-specific model training function across each group. The `applyInPandas` method is applied on the grouped data, allowing us to train a model for each neighborhood.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Define the schema for the output DataFrame, which includes the group name, model path, MSE, and the number of records used in training.
# MAGIC 2. Group the DataFrame by the `neighbourhood_cleansed` column and apply the `train_group_model` function.
# MAGIC 3. Display the results, showing the model path, MSE, and other metrics for each neighborhood.

# COMMAND ----------

    StructField("mse", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("n_used", IntegerType(), True)
])

# Apply the group-specific model training function using 'applyInPandas'
result_df = airbnb_df.groupby("neighbourhood_cleansed").applyInPandas(train_group_model, schema=schema)

# Display the result DataFrame showing the model path, MSE, and number of records for each group
display(result_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Part 5: Group-Specific Inference Using Pandas Function API
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this part, you will perform **inference for each neighborhood** using the models we previously trained and logged in **MLflow**. The goal is to load the appropriate model for each neighborhood and make predictions based on the features from the test data. After that, we will compare the predicted prices to the actual prices and evaluate the accuracy of the models.
# MAGIC
