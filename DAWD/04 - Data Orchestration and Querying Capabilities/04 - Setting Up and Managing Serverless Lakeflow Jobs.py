# MAGIC # Demo: Setting Up and Managing Serverless Lakeflow Jobs  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, weâ€™ll set up a **Databricks Lakeflow Jobs** leveraging SQL tasks to automate a series of **Data Warehousing** tasks. These tasks include data ingestion, validation, transformation, and generating insights within a **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). Additionally, we will explore error handling, retries, scheduling options, and integration with external tools.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Learning Objectives**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By the end of this demo, you will learn how to:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Create a Lakeflow Job with **SQL tasks** for a Medallion Architecture pipeline.
# MAGIC - Set up task dependencies and implement conditional logic for lakeflow jobs control.
# MAGIC - Use the Lakeflow Job UI for **monitoring** and **data lineage visualization** to trace data transformations and dependencies.
# MAGIC - Configure error handling and retries for tasks.
# MAGIC - Schedule Lakeflow Job using manual triggers.
# MAGIC - Set up **notifications** for monitoring and analyze the execution history.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC     - In the drop-down, select **More**.
# MAGIC     - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** pop-up, select the first drop-down. You will see a unique cluster name in that drop-down. Please select that cluster.
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC 1. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC 1. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.

# MAGIC - **Governance and Compliance:** Track data transformations and usage for regulatory requirements.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC #### Viewing Lineage in Unity Catalog
# MAGIC The following code helps you access the lineage information for a table directly in the Databricks UI.

# COMMAND ----------

# Generate the workspace URL dynamically
workspace_url = f"https://{spark.conf.get('spark.databricks.workspaceUrl')}"

# Define the table name for which to view the lineage
table_name = "order_table_gold"  # Replace with any other table name as needed

# Construct the URL for the data lineage page in Unity Catalog
lineage_url = f"{workspace_url}/explore/data/{DA.catalog_name}/{DA.schema_name}/{table_name}?activeTab=lineage"

# Print a user-friendly message with the lineage URL
print(f"Access the data lineage for the table '{table_name}' using the following URL:")

# Display the URL as a clickable link in Databricks
displayHTML(f'<a href="{lineage_url}" target="_blank">Click here to view the lineage for {table_name}</a>')

# MAGIC - Set up email notifications to stay updated on job execution.
# MAGIC - Trigger the Lakeflow job manually and monitor its execution.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This Lakeflow Jobs setup ensures robust automation for DLT pipelines with integrated troubleshooting and notification mechanisms. The conditional paths provide flexibility to handle success and failure scenarios efficiently, while monitoring and logging enhance visibility into pipeline executions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Additionally, you explored how to leverage **data lineage** within Unity Catalog, enabling deeper insights into the relationships between datasets and transformations. This feature enhances governance, auditing, and troubleshooting across your Lakeflow Jobs.
